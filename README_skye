If you want to use skye mavlink messages, rename user_config.pri.dist to user_config.pri
If you are using Linux, you can additionally use 3dConnexion 3d mouse:

Linux:
======
Follow instructions below or http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/3DConnexion_Devices_Support

# =========== 3dConnexion Support on Linux System ==============
# 
# Install required packages: (on ubuntu 10.04 take libmotif3)
sudo apt-get install libmotif4
# And make a link on it because driver looks for libXm.so.3
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libXm.so.4 /usr/lib/libXm.so.3
# 
# Get newest Linux driver from
# http://www.3dconnexion.com/support/downloads.php
# 
# Install the driver
# If you downloaded the driver (I did x86) to Downloads folder, do:
cd /tmp
tar xzvf ~/Downloads/3dxware-linux-v1-6-0.x86_64.tar.gz
sudo ./install-3dxunix.sh

# If you are asked to install 3DxWareUnix, press y
# Then choose your platform (Linux, 4)
# Let 3DxWareUnix be started at every login
# It's a USB device
# -> Installation is done!

# Then change permissions of installed files in /etc/3DxWare:
sudo chmod go+rx /etc/3DxWare
sudo chmod go+r /etc/3DxWare/*.scg 

# ============ START DRIVER =================
# If you want to start the driver:
sudo /etc/3DxWare/daemon/3dxsrv -d usb

# Then start a demo in a new terminal (ctrl+shift+T):
/tmp/xcube
# or:
/tmp/xvalue

# ============ 3DConnexion SDK ===============
# 
# You may also need the 3DConnexion SDK. Get the xdevelop.tgz from here:
# http://www.3dconnexion.com/support/sdk.php

# Unzip at any place:
cd /tmp
tar xzvf ~/Downloads/xdevelop.tgz

# Get cmake
sudo apt-get install cmake
	# If <sudo cmake CMakeList.txt> errors with 
	## CMake Error: your CXX compiler: "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND" was not found.
	# Then get g++
	sudo apt-get install g++

# Build and install the CMake project:
# Download this file (http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/File:CMakeLists.txt)!
mkdir build
cd build
cp ~/Downloads/CMakeLists.txt /tmp
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

# Probably you don't have ccmake installed, then type:
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui

	# Now you'll probably need to add /usr/local/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your ~/.bashrc:
	gedit ~/.bashrc
	# Add this line:
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
	# Then execute
	source ~/.bashrc

# You can try now to run xapp:
sudo /etc/3DxWare/daemon/3dxsrv -d usb
cd /usr/local/bin
./xapp
